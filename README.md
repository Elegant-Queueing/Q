# Q

## What is Q?
Q is an all-in-one solution for career fairs. We all have attended chaotic career fairs and have stood in insanely long queues waiting for long periods of time to talk to the employers. Our solution tackles the career fair problem from both the student's and employer's perspective. Some of the issues that we want to mitigate are:

   #### Issues that students face at a career fair:
   - Standing in long unorganized queues for companies, with no accurate information about the estimated queue time.
   - Filling out similar forms repeatedly for different companies.
   - Inability to keep track of feedback we receive at career fairs.
   - Lack of information about the roles, sponsorship, hiring timelines for companies.

   #### Issues that employers face at a career fair:
   - Managing queues and assigning students to the correct engineer manually.
   - Going through a stack of resumes again to filter out the students who fit with the company requirements.
   - Unable to efficiently maintain and collect notes during conversation with applicants.
